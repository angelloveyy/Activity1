        <h2>OVERVIEW OF PHILIPPINE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND WELFARE</h2>
   <p>Republic Act No. 9344 or the “Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act” defines the Juvenile Justice and Welfare System as a system dealing with children at risk and children in conflict with the law, which provides child-appropriate proceedings, including programmes and services for prevention, diversion, reha- bilitation, re-integration and aftercare to ensure their normal growth and development.</p>     
  <p>A child can commit an act or omission whether punishable under special laws or the amended Revised Pena Code which is referred to as an "Offence". Under Republic Act 10630. offences which only apoly to : child and not to adults are called Status Otlences .

<p>As an offshoot of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the R.A. No. 9344 intends to deal with these children without resorting to judicial proceedings. Instead of punishing juvenile offenders and treating them as criminals, these child offenders will be provided by the State and the community with assistance to prevent them from committing future offences</p>
